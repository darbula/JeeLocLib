/**
 * Protocol being used here demands usage of header and data in the payload.
 * It is best described with the following struct that should be defined in
 * program:
 * struct Message {
 *   // header defines:
 *   //   * type of the message allowing to have different structures for the
 *   //     data section
 *   //   * id of the sending node, reasoning for including it is given below
 *   //     beside code where ack is being sent
 *   uint8_t type;
 *   uint8_t source;
 *   // data structures matching different message types are defined as union
 *   // maximum struct size in this union should be RF12_MAXDATA - 2, i.e. 64
 *   union {
 *     struct tokenS token;
 *     struct aoAResponseS aoAResponse;
 *   };
 * };
 *
 */

/**
 * Message collision handling
 * --------------------------
 * Message collision that can happen in synchronised response to broadcast
 * such as AoAResponse is avoided by variable id-based send postponement.
 * There two scenarios:
 * 1. if node is expecting other messages while waiting to send then use
 * postponement with timer/alarm. Cost of this technique is memory used to
 * temporarily store data to send. Also, while waiting assert that no other
 * event should trigger sending new postponed message.
 * 2. if node is not expecting any incoming messages or alarms use blocking
 * delay sending without need for temporary storage.
 *
 * Message collision can happen in more generic case when there is no
 * synchronised responding. One example is LetUsStitch message sent whenever
 * node is ready to send it. In that case variable id based postponement is not
 * the solution. This problem is solved with acknowledgments and
 * random waiting resend postponements. Those postponement resends could be
 * accomplished in form of scenarios described above. For LetUsStitch the
 * blocking scenario is more appropriate i.e. simpler and feasible since during
 * blocking delay node is not expected to receive any message and all alarms
 * are disarmed. Sending with ack request and blocking delay is implemented in
 * send_req_ack().
